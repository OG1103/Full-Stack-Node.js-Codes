/* 
  4. perspective: Defines the perspective from which a 3D element is viewed.
  
  The 'perspective' property is used to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective, making the element look like itâ€™s closer or farther away from the viewer.
  It affects the appearance of child elements that are transformed in 3D space.
  
  Syntax:
    perspective: [value];
  
  Parameters:
  - Value: Defines the distance from the viewer to the z=0 plane. A smaller value results in a more pronounced 3D effect, while a larger value results in a flatter appearance.
  
  Examples of using 'perspective':
*/

/* Example 1: Simple Perspective */
.example-perspective1 {
  perspective: 600px; /* Moderate perspective distance for 3D child elements */
}

/* Example 2: Strong Perspective Effect */
.example-perspective2 {
  perspective: 200px; /* Strong perspective effect, making 3D transformations more pronounced */
}

/* Example 3: Combined with Rotate */
.example-perspective3 {
  perspective: 800px; /* Adds perspective to a container */
}

.example-perspective3-child {
  transform: rotateY(30deg); /* Rotates child element in 3D space */
}
