Difference Between fetch() and axios:
-------------------------------------
fetch() is a native JavaScript API that is built into modern browsers.
axios is a third-party library that simplifies making HTTP requests 
Both fetch() and axios are used for making HTTP requests from the front end to interact with the back end using promises to handle requests asynchronously. 
However, they differ in their implementation, functionality, and the way they handle requests and responses.

When to Use fetch()
------------------
Lightweight Projects: If you don't need advanced features like request cancellation, interceptors, or timeouts, and you're comfortable with manual error handling and response parsing, fetch() is a great lightweight option.

Modern Browsers: Since fetch() is natively supported in modern browsers, it's ideal for projects where you don't need to worry about older browser compatibility (like Internet Explorer).

Smaller Projects: If you're building a smaller app that doesn't require complex HTTP handling, fetch() provides a simple, native solution without adding extra dependencies to your project.

When to Use Axios:
----------------
Advanced Features: If your project needs features like request cancellation, interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, or request timeouts, Axios is a better choice.

Backwards Compatibility: Axios works with older browsers (like Internet Explorer) out of the box, while fetch() needs a polyfill for such environments.

Larger or Complex Projects: In a larger app or complex project where you need to handle multiple API requests, intercept requests and responses, or deal with authentication, Axios offers more powerful features and simpler syntax.

Conclusion:
Both fetch() and Axios serve the same overall purposeâ€”sending HTTP requests and handling responses. However, Axios provides a more feature-rich experience 
and handles many common use cases (like error handling, JSON parsing, and timeouts) out of the box, making it easier for developers working on larger, more complex applications.

Use fetch() for lightweight projects and where browser support is not an issue.
Use Axios for feature-rich applications that require better error handling, interceptors, and request cancellation, or when you need to support older browsers.
