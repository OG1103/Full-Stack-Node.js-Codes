# Difference Between `fetch()` and Axios

## Introduction
Both **`fetch()`** and **Axios** are used for making HTTP requests from the front end to interact with the back end by returning/using **promises** to handle requests asynchronously. However, they differ in their **implementation**, **functionality**, and the way they **handle requests and responses**.

### `fetch()`
- A native JavaScript API built into modern browsers.
- Lightweight and provides a simple interface for making requests.
- Requires manual handling of many common tasks like error handling and JSON parsing.

### Axios
- A third-party library that simplifies making HTTP requests.
- Provides advanced features like request cancellation, interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, and request timeouts.
- Handles many common use cases (like error handling and JSON parsing) out of the box.

## When to Use `fetch()`

### 1. Lightweight Projects
If you don't need advanced features like request cancellation, interceptors, or timeouts, and you're comfortable with manual error handling and response parsing, **`fetch()`** is a great lightweight option.

### 2. Modern Browsers
Since `fetch()` is natively supported in modern browsers, it's ideal for projects where you don't need to worry about older browser compatibility (like Internet Explorer).

### 3. Smaller Projects
If you're building a smaller app that doesn't require complex HTTP handling, `fetch()` provides a simple, native solution without adding extra dependencies to your project.

## When to Use Axios

### 1. Advanced Features
If your project needs features like:
- **Request cancellation**
- **Interceptors**
- **Automatic JSON parsing**
- **Request timeouts**
then Axios is a better choice.

### 2. Backwards Compatibility
Axios works with **older browsers** (like Internet Explorer) out of the box, while `fetch()` needs a **polyfill** for such environments.

### 3. Larger or Complex Projects
In a larger app or complex project where you need to:
- Handle multiple API requests
- Intercept requests and responses
- Deal with authentication
Axios offers more powerful features and simpler syntax.

## Conclusion
Both `fetch()` and Axios serve the same overall purposeâ€”**sending HTTP requests and handling responses**. However, Axios provides a more feature-rich experience and handles many common use cases (like error handling, JSON parsing, and timeouts) out of the box, making it easier for developers working on larger, more complex applications.

- Use **`fetch()`** for lightweight projects and where browser support is not an issue.
- Use **Axios** for feature-rich applications that require better error handling, interceptors, and request cancellation, or when you need to support older browsers.

## Error Handling in `fetch()` vs Axios

### `fetch()`
- The **`fetch()` API** behaves differently from Axios when it comes to handling non-2xx responses.
- The **`fetch()` API** does not throw an error for HTTP responses outside the 2xx range (like 400 or 500).
- Instead, it **resolves the promise successfully**, and it's up to you to check the response status code and handle it accordingly.
- Only **network errors** (like DNS issues or the server being unreachable) will trigger the `catch` block.

#### Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}
fetchData();
```
- In this example, `response.ok` is checked to determine if the response status code indicates success. If not, an error is manually thrown.

---

### Axios
- In Axios, when a request results in a response with an **HTTP status code outside the 2xx range** (like 400, 404, 500, etc.), Axios **automatically throws an error**, which is caught by the `catch` block.
- This behavior is different from `fetch()`, where non-2xx responses are considered successful and do not throw an error automatically.

#### Example:
```javascript
async function fetchDataWithAxios() {
    try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
        console.log(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.response) {
            // Server responded with a status other than 2xx
            console.error('Error response:', error.response);
        } else if (error.request) {
            // No response was received
            console.error('No response received:', error.request);
        } else {
            // Something else caused the error
            console.error('Error:', error.message);
        }
    }
}
fetchDataWithAxios();
```
- In this example:
  - **`error.response`** contains the server's response (including status and data) if the error occurred due to a server response.
  - **`error.request`** contains the request object if no response was received.
  - **`error.message`** contains a string describing the error.

## Summary of Error Handling
| Feature               | `fetch()`                                              | Axios                                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Error on non-2xx**  | No, manual handling required                           | Yes, automatic error throwing                           |
| **Error on network issues** | Yes                                                   | Yes                                                     |
| **Response object**   | Must manually check `response.ok` and parse `.json()`  | Automatically parsed JSON available in `response.data`  |
| **Error object**      | Basic error object with `message`                     | Detailed error object with `response`, `request`, etc. |
