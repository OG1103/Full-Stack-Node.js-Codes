working with Databases and Collections in MongoDB:
---------------------------------------------------

in

SHELL COMMANDS/METHODS; Initializing Database:
--------------------------------------
    - show dbs: shows all the databases in the server you are connected to. Only shows the database that atleast have one collection where that collection has atleast one document.
    
    - db: shows the current selected database.
    
    - use <database_name>: allows you to select/ use the database name provided. If the database_name provided doesn't exist then mongoDB creates that database for you and makes it in use.
      Note: by default a test database is selected.
    
    - db.dropDatabase() : drops the current selected database. 

SHELL COMMANDS/METHODS; Working With Collections:
--------------------------------------
    - db.<collection_name>: creates a collection in the selected database.
    - db.createCollection(collection name,{options}): Another way to create a collection however i can specify some options.
      - options are key Value pairs:
        1. capped:true => Sets a fixed size (has to be specified) such that once the database reaches that size, it overwrites the oldest enteries with the new ones.
        2. size:N => N= max size in bytes for a capped collection. 
        3. autoIndexId: true => sets an index on the _id field.
        4. max: N => N= Max no of documents

    - show collections: shows all the collections you have in the selected database

    - db.<collection_name>.insertOne({fields:values}): allows you to insert one document in collection_name in the selected database. 
      If collection does not exist MongoDB creates them for you. we pass a document in json format as it's argument.

     - db.<collection_name>.find(): returns an array of all the documents inside collection_name in the selected database. 

     - db.<collection_name>.drop(): drops the collection specified in the selected database.
