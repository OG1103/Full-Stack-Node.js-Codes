Working With MongoDB
------------------------------

ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION:
---------------------------
Connection String Format:
  - mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?<options>
  - or, if you're using MongoDB Atlas (the cloud-hosted MongoDB service):
    - mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database>?<options>
  
  Example for Local MongoDB:
    - mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase
    - localhost:27017: Refers to the MongoDB instance running locally on port 27017.
    - myDatabase: This is the database you want to connect to. If it doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it the first time you insert data.
  Example for MongoDB Atlas:
    - mongodb+srv://user123:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    - myDatabase: This is the database name you want to connect to. Replace myDatabase with the name of the database you intend to use.


SHELL:
------
    - Shell Is a client in which we use to connect to a db server
    - cls: clears shell terminal


NOTES:
-------
  - when working with MongoDB in Node.js using the native MongoDB driver or libraries like Mongoose. 
    Once you've connected to the database and have a reference to the collection, you don't need to prefix with db. anymore. You can directly invoke methods on the collection object.
