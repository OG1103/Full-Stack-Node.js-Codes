# Understanding Signed Cookies in Express.js

## Signed Cookies
Signed cookies are used to ensure the integrity of the cookie's value. When a cookie is signed, Express adds a cryptographic signature to verify that the cookie value hasn't been tampered with by the client.

### Enabling Signed Cookies
To use signed cookies, you need to set a `secret` in your Express app. This secret is used to sign and verify the cookies.

### Setting Signed Cookies
You can enable signed cookies by setting the `signed` option to `true` in the `res.cookie` method.

#### Example
```javascript
import express from 'express';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

const app = express();

// Set a secret for signing cookies
app.use(cookieParser('your_secret_key'));

app.get('/set-signed-cookie', (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('auth_token', 'secure_value', { signed: true, httpOnly: true });
    res.send('Signed cookie has been set!');
});
```

### Accessing Signed Cookies
To access signed cookies, you can use the `req.signedCookies` object provided by the `cookie-parser` middleware.

#### Example
```javascript
app.get('/read-signed-cookie', (req, res) => {
    const authToken = req.signedCookies.auth_token;
    if (authToken) {
        res.send(`Signed cookie value: ${authToken}`);
    } else {
        res.send('No signed cookie found.');
    }
});
```

## Security Benefits of Signed Cookies
1. **Integrity Protection**: The cryptographic signature ensures that the cookie's value has not been altered by the client. If the signature verification fails, the signed cookie is ignored.
2. **Authentication**: Helps secure sensitive data (e.g., session tokens) in cookies.
3. **Tamper Detection**: Provides an additional layer of protection against malicious users trying to manipulate cookie values.

### Important Notes
- Always use `httpOnly` and `secure` options for cookies containing sensitive data.
  - `httpOnly`: Prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie.
  - `secure`: Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS.
- Use a strong and unique `secret` for signing cookies.
- Signed cookies do not encrypt the value; they only protect against tampering. If confidentiality is required, consider encrypting the value before setting the cookie.

## Example Application
Below is a full example of using signed cookies in an Express.js application:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

const app = express();

// Middleware for parsing cookies and signed cookies
app.use(cookieParser('my_secret_key'));

// Route to set a signed cookie
app.get('/set-signed-cookie', (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('session_id', '12345', { signed: true, httpOnly: true, secure: true });
    res.send('Signed cookie set.');
});

// Route to read the signed cookie
app.get('/get-signed-cookie', (req, res) => {
    const sessionId = req.signedCookies.session_id;
    if (sessionId) {
        res.send(`Signed cookie value: ${sessionId}`);
    } else {
        res.send('No signed cookie found or verification failed.');
    }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## Summary
- Use `res.cookie` to set cookies and the `signed` option to sign them.
- Signed cookies ensure the integrity of the cookie's value.
- Access signed cookies using `req.signedCookies`.
- Combine signed cookies with `httpOnly`, `secure`, and a strong `secret` for enhanced security.
