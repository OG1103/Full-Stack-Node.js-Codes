# Understanding `req.file` Properties in Express File Uploads

When handling file uploads in Express using middleware like `multer`, the details about the uploaded file are stored in `req.file` (for single file uploads) or `req.files` (for multiple file uploads). The structure of `req.file` depends on the storage engine being used (e.g., local disk, Cloudinary, AWS S3).

## Properties of `req.file`

### **1. Local Storage (`multer.diskStorage`):**
When using `multer.diskStorage`, `req.file` contains the following properties:

| **Property**      | **Description**                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fieldname`       | Name of the field in the form (`name` attribute in `<input>`).                                           |
| `originalname`    | The original name of the file as uploaded by the user.                                                   |
| `encoding`        | The encoding type of the file (e.g., `7bit`).                                                            |
| `mimetype`        | The MIME type of the file (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `application/pdf`).                                       |
| `destination`     | The folder where the file has been saved (e.g., `uploads/`).                                             |
| `filename`        | The name of the file in the destination folder (e.g., `1673445678901-example.jpg`).                      |
| `path`            | The full path to the uploaded file on the server (e.g., `uploads/1673445678901-example.jpg`).            |

## Accessing `req.file` Properties in a Controller

Hereâ€™s how to access and use the properties in `req.file`:

```javascript
export const handleFileUpload = (req, res) => {
  try {
    console.log("File metadata:", req.file);

    // Example for local storage
    const filePath = req.file.path;

    // Example for Cloudinary
    const cloudUrl = req.file.path; // Public URL

    // Example for AWS S3
    const s3Url = req.file.location;

    res.json({
      message: "File uploaded successfully!",
      fileDetails: req.file,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error handling file upload:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to upload file" });
  }
};
```
