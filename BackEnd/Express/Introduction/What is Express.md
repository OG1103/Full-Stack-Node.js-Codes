# What is Express?

**Express.js** (or just **Express**) is a minimal and flexible **Node.js web application framework** that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
It is widely used for building web servers and APIs.

## Key Features of Express

### 1. Routing

- Express allows you to define different routes of your application (URLs/endpoints) and specify how they respond to HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
- It provides a clean and powerful API to handle routes and middleware.

### 2. Middleware

- Middleware in Express are functions that execute between the time a request is received and when a response is sent.
- Middleware functions can be used to modify the request and response objects, log requests, handle authentication, etc.

### 3. Server Setup

- Express simplifies the process of setting up a server. With just a few lines of code, you can initialize a server to handle HTTP requests.
- You can define ports, configure settings, and listen for requests efficiently.

### 4. Handling Requests

- You can process different types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handle query parameters, request bodies, and headers.

### 5. Using Cookies

- Express provides support for handling cookies in web applications.
- By using middleware such as `cookie-parser`, you can easily parse and set cookies, manage sessions, and store small amounts of data for a specific client.
