/*
  This file explains how to use the `pipe` method in Node.js streams to read from a readable stream and write to a writable stream.

  `pipe()` allows data to be passed from one stream to another.
*/

const fs = require("fs");

// Create a readable stream from a file
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", "utf8");

// Create a writable stream to write to another file
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt", "utf8");

//You donâ€™t need to wrap readStream.pipe(writeStream) in an 'open' event listener because pipe handles the necessary events internally.
// Use the 'open' event only when you need custom pre-pipe logic, such as logging or additional checks.
readStream.on("open", () => {
  console.log("Read stream opened.");
  readStream.pipe(writeStream);
});

// Handle the 'finish' event for the write stream
writeStream.on("finish", () => {
  console.log("Data piped and written successfully.");
});

// Handle errors in both streams
readStream.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error reading the file:", err);
});

writeStream.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error writing to the file:", err);
});
