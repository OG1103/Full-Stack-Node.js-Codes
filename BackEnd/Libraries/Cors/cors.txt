What is it?
------------
- CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain (cross-origin).

How does it work?
-----------------
- When a cross-origin request is made (e.g., JavaScript in a web page trying to fetch data from an API on another domain), 
  the browser automatically sends an HTTP request header called Origin, which specifies the origin of the request.

- The server checks the Origin and, if the server supports CORS for the specific domain, it responds with the appropriate CORS headers. These headers allow the browser to either permit or deny the cross-origin request.

Overview of the cors Library:
-----------------------------
- The cors library is a Node.js middleware that allows you to enable and configure CORS for your server or specific routes in an Express.js or similar application.
- It simplifies handling CORS by adding the appropriate HTTP headers automatically.

Installation:
--------------
- npm install cors

Basic Usage:
------------
// Enable CORS for all routes
app.use(cors());


Configuring CORS:
-----------------
- Check js file
