What is a Type Alias in TypeScript?
----------------------------------
- A type alias in TypeScript is a way to give a custom name (alias) to a specific type. 
- It allows you to create a type with a more readable or meaningful name, making your code easier to understand

Syntax:
-------
type AliasName = Type;

Example: 
type Name = string;
let firstName: Name = "Alice";

Name is an alias for the type string. Now, instead of writing string, you can refer to the type Name.

Example: Object Type Alias
--------------------------
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isStudent: boolean;
};

let student: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 21,
  isStudent: true
};
