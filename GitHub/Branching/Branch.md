## üöÄ **Introduction to Git Branches**

A **Git branch** is an independent line of development in your project. Branches help you work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

- **`main` or `master`**: The default branch where the production code lives.
- **Feature branches**: For developing new features.
- **Hotfix branches**: For urgent bug fixes.

## ‚úÖ **Creating and Managing Branches**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a New Local Branch**

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a new branch locally.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git branch feature-login
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **List All Branches**

```bash
git branch
```
- **Purpose:** Lists all local branches.
- **List Remote Branches:**
  ```bash
  git branch -r
  ```
- **List Local + Remote Branches:**
  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Rename the Current Branch**

```bash
git branch -m <new-branch-name>
```
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git branch -m feature-dashboard
  ```
- **Rename Another Branch:**
  ```bash
  git branch -m old-name new-name
  ```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Switch Between Branches**

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```
OR using the newer command:
```bash
git switch <branch-name>
```
- **Purpose:** Switches to another branch.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git checkout develop
  ```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Create and Switch to a New Branch (One Command)**

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
OR:
```bash
git switch -c <branch-name>
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a new branch and switches to it immediately.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-payment
  ```

## üåê **Working with Remote Branches**

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Show Remote Repositories**

```bash
git remote -v
```
- **Purpose:** Lists all remote repositories connected to your project.
- **Example Output:**
  ```
  origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
  origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
  ```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Local Branch from a Remote Branch and Start Committing**

```bash
git checkout -b <local-branch-name> origin/<remote-branch-name>
```
OR:
```bash
git switch -c <local-branch-name> --track origin/<remote-branch-name>
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a local branch based on a remote branch.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-login origin/feature-login
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - `-b`: Creates the new branch.
  - `origin/feature-login`: Specifies the remote branch to track.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Pull the Latest Changes from Remote**

```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git pull origin feature-login
  ```
- **Purpose:** Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.

---

## ‚ùå **Deleting Branches**

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Delete a Local Branch (Safe Method)**

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```
- **Purpose:** Deletes the branch only if it has been merged.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature-login
  ```

### üî• **Force Delete a Local Branch (Unsafe Method)**

```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
```
- **Purpose:** Deletes the branch even if it has unmerged changes.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git branch -D feature-login
  ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- You **cannot delete** the branch you‚Äôre currently on.
- Switch to another branch before deleting:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  ```

| Create & switch to a new branch                | `git checkout -b <branch-name>`            |
| Create a local branch from a remote branch     | `git checkout -b <local> origin/<remote>`  |
| Pull latest changes from remote                | `git pull origin <branch-name>`            |
| Delete a local branch (safe)                   | `git branch -d <branch-name>`              |
| Force delete a local branch                    | `git branch -D <branch-name>`              |
