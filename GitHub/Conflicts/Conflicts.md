## üöÄ **Introduction to Git Conflicts**

A **Git conflict** occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes between branches because the same part of the code has been modified differently in separate branches. These conflicts typically happen during:

- **Pulling changes** from a remote repository.
- **Merging** branches.
- **Rebasing** commits.
- **Pushing** changes when the remote branch has diverged from the local branch.

## üîÑ **Pushing Conflicts: Scenarios and Solutions**

When you pull changes from a remote branch, make your own changes, and then try to push back to the same branch, the following scenarios may occur:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **No Conflicts and Fast-Forward Merge**

- **Scenario:**
  - The remote branch hasn‚Äôt changed since your last pull.
  - No conflicting changes exist.

- **What Happens:**
  - Git performs a **fast-forward merge**, simply moving the branch pointer forward.
  - Your push will be **successful**.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git pull origin main  # Up-to-date
  # Make changes locally
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add new feature"
  git push origin main  # Successful push
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **No Conflicts, No Fast-Forward Merge**

- **Scenario:**
  - The remote branch has been updated since your last pull.
  - **No conflicting changes** exist because the changes affect different files/lines.

- **What Happens:**
  - Git attempts to **merge** the remote changes with your local changes.
  - You might need to pull, resolve minor merges (if needed), and then push.

- **Solution:**
  ```bash
  git pull origin main  # Merges remote changes
  # Resolve any minor merges (if prompted)
  git push origin main  # Push successful after merging
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge Conflicts (Direct Conflicts)**

- **Scenario:**
  - The remote branch has been updated.
  - There are **conflicting changes** in the same files or lines you‚Äôre working on.

- **What Happens:**
  - Git **cannot auto-merge** the changes.
  - You‚Äôll receive an error message indicating a conflict.

- **Error Example:**
  ```bash
  ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
  error: failed to push some refs to 'origin/main'
  hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
  not have locally. Integrate the remote changes before pushing again.
  ```

- **Solution:**
  1. **Pull the latest changes:**
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
  2. **Identify conflicted files:**
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
  3. **Resolve conflicts manually:**
     - Look for conflict markers:
       ```
       <<<<<<< HEAD
       Your changes
       =======
       Remote changes
       >>>>>>> origin/main
       ```
     - Edit to keep the desired code.

  4. **Mark as resolved:**
     ```bash
     git add <conflicted-file>
     ```
  5. **Complete the merge:**
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
     ```
  6. **Push the changes:**
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

## üîß **Resolving Merge Conflicts**

### üìù **Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts:**
1. **Run `git pull`** to fetch the latest changes.
2. **Check for conflicts** using:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
3. **Open conflicted files** and manually resolve conflicts.
4. **Stage the resolved files:**
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
5. **Commit the merge:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
   ```
6. **Push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch>
   ```

### üö® **Abort a Merge (if needed):**
If you want to cancel the merge:
```bash
git merge --abort
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Preventing Git Conflicts**

- **Pull frequently:** Always pull the latest changes before starting new work.
- **Work on feature branches:** Avoid working directly on `main` or `master`.
- **Communicate with your team:** Avoid working on the same files simultaneously.
- **Use rebase wisely:** Rebasing keeps a clean commit history but may lead to conflicts if not handled carefully.

| Check status of conflicts                | `git status`                             |
| Mark conflict as resolved                | `git add <file>`                         |
| Commit after resolving conflict          | `git commit -m "Resolved conflict"`      |
| Force push (if necessary)                | `git push --force`                       |
| Abort a merge                            | `git merge --abort`                      |
