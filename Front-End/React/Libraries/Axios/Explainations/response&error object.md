# Understanding Axios Response and Error Objects

When working with Axios, understanding how to handle successful and failed requests is essential. This guide provides a detailed explanation of the objects returned in both cases and how you can access and use relevant information.

## **Axios Response and Error Objects**

### **1. Response Object in Axios**

The response object is returned when a request is successful (i.e., the HTTP status code is in the `2xx` range). You can access various details about the server's response:

#### **Key Properties of the Response Object**

1. **`response.data`**:

   - Contains the data sent by the server in response to your request.
   - Typically, this is a JSON object returned by your API.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const response = await axios.get(url);
     console.log(response.data); // Logs the server's response data
     ```

2. **`response.status`**:

   - The HTTP status code returned by the server (e.g., `200` for success, `404` for not found, `500` for server error).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(response.status); // Logs the HTTP status code
     ```

3. **`response.statusText`**:

   - A short description of the status code (e.g., "OK" for `200`, "Not Found" for `404`).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(response.statusText); // Logs "OK"
     ```

4. **`response.headers`**:

   - The response headers sent back from the server.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(response.headers); // Logs response headers
     ```

5. **`response.config`**:

   - The Axios configuration object used to make the request.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(response.config); // Logs the Axios request configuration
     ```

6. **`response.request`**:
   - The request object that was made.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(response.request); // Logs details about the request made
     ```

### **2. Error Object in Axios**

The error object is returned when a request fails (i.e., the HTTP status code is outside the `2xx` range, or there are network issues). You can access various details about what went wrong:

#### **Key Properties of the Error Object**

1. **`error.response`**:

   - Contains the response object sent back by the server when the status code indicates an error (e.g., `4xx`, `5xx`).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     try {
       const response = await axios.get(url);
     } catch (error) {
       if (error.response) {
         console.log(error.response.data); // Logs error data from server
         console.log(error.response.status); // Logs error status code
         console.log(error.response.headers); // Logs error headers
       }
     }
     ```

2. **`error.request`**:

   - Contains the request object that was made but did not receive a response.
   - This typically happens in cases of network issues, timeouts, or when the server did not respond.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(error.request); // Logs the request object
     ```

3. **`error.message`**:

   - A general message about what went wrong, such as "Network Error" or "Request failed with status code 500".
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(error.message); // Logs a descriptive error message
     ```

4. **`error.isAxiosError`**:
   - A boolean flag (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the error was generated by Axios.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(error.isAxiosError); // Logs true for Axios errors
     ```

## **Handling Axios Responses and Errors**

### **Example: Handling Successful and Failed Requests**

```javascript
try {
  const response = await axios.method(url, data);
  console.log(response.data); // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  if (error.response) {
    // Non-2xx response from the server
    console.log(error.response.data); // Error data
    console.log(error.response.status); // Error status code
  } else if (error.request) {
    // No response received
    console.log(error.request);
  } else {
    // General error message
    console.log(error.message);
  }
}
```

### **Notes on Axios Behavior**

- **Successful Requests**:

  - Axios resolves with a response object containing details about the HTTP response.
  - The `response.status` can be used to determine whether the server returned a success or an error within the `2xx` range.

- **Failed Requests**:
  - Axios considers any HTTP status code outside the `2xx` range as an error and rejects the promise.
  - The `catch` block handles errors, providing access to the `error.response`, `error.request`, and `error.message` properties.

---

## **Summary**

- **Response Object**:

  - Use `response.data`, `response.status`, and other properties to access details of a successful response.

- **Error Object**:
  - Use `error.response`, `error.request`, and `error.message` to handle different error scenarios.

By understanding these objects, you can efficiently handle both successful and failed Axios requests in your application.
