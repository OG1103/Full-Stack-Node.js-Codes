# useState Hook in React

## Introduction

`useState` is one of the most fundamental React hooks that allows functional components to have state. Traditionally, class components were used to manage state, but with `useState`, you can now add stateful logic directly within functional components.

## What is a State?

State is an object in React that holds information or data that can change over time. It is used to track and store the dynamic aspects of your component that can be updated or re-rendered based on user interaction or other factors. Each time the state is updated, the component re-renders to reflect the new state values.

Every time setState function is called, the component will re-render with the new state.

## Syntax

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

- **state**: The current state value.
- **setState**: A function that updates the state value.
- **initialState**: The initial value of the state when the component renders for the first time.

- **setState** can either take a direct new value/variable which assings it ot the stateor a function that uses the previous state to compute the new one

- The basic syntax for using the setState function with a callback to access the previous state is as follows:

```js
// The element passed into the function (in this case previousState) represents the current state that will be used to compute the new state value.
setState((previousState) => {
  // logic to calculate new state based on previous state
  return newState;
});
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `useState` to manage a counter Functional Componenet:

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable 'count' initialized to 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Function to increment the count
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial State**:
   The state `count` is initialized to `0`. This value is passed as the argument to `useState(0)`.

2. **State Update**:
   When the button is clicked, the `increment` function is triggered, which calls `setCount(count + 1)`. This updates the state with the new value, causing the component to re-render with the updated `count`.

3. **Re-render**:
   Whenever the state changes, React re-renders the component with the new state value. In this case, every time the button is clicked, the new count value is displayed.

## Multiple State Variables

You can use multiple `useState` hooks within the same component to manage different pieces of state:

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

function UserProfile() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("John Doe");
  const [age, setAge] = useState(25);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setAge(age + 1)}>Increase Age</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;
```

## Key Points

- **Initial Value**: `useState` accepts one argument as the initial state value.
- **State Updater**: The state updater function (`setState`) allows you to modify the state.
- **Re-renders**: Calling the state updater causes React to re-render the component with the updated state.
- **Multiple States**: You can have multiple `useState` hooks to handle different state variables.

## Conclusion

`useState` is a powerful hook that simplifies state management in functional components. It allows you to easily manage and update state, making React functional components more powerful and easier to work with.
