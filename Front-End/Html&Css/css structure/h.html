Typically, in a <div> element, I style the container to define its placement, dimensions, and layout. 
Within this container, I assign different styles to the elements inside the <div>, which may include other <div> elements. 
This process can be repeated as needed to create a structured layout.

      <!-- Here we assign class (the css class we want to assign to this element)-->
      <!-- we can aslo assign an element id, and using css we can assign style to this element utilizing its element id . In css (#elementid{})
           this element id is used for many things as well in html, js and css. Best practice to give important / freq accessed elements an id-->

        <!-- there is a div-2 class, it will go to this and take the style of this sinmce there is no overridding class that has a parent selector. If there is a .parent-5 .div-2 class 
        in css it will take the style of this class instead of .div-2 class. But since it doesnt exist, it takes the basic .div-2 class.
        Any element that has a class thats not overriden by parent selectors will take style of class. So best practice instead of naming classes uniquesly, to differntiate we include 
        parent selectors between different classes. -->

    <div class="div-2">testinggggggggg</div>
    <!-- To confirm last div doesnt have a parent -> no parent selector for a certain class so it will take the base .div-2 class automaticaly. Just like the big div above it no class includes 
     the parent selector (.parent-5 .div-2) so nothing to override the base class div-2 so that nested div inside that, has class div-2 will that that style(.div-2)-->

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
