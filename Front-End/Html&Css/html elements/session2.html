    <!-- IMAGES-->
    <img src="../imgs/B15A1275.JPG" alt="shirt" width="0" height="0" />
    <!-- img tag is self closing means we put a / at the end of the opening tag-->
    <!-- src attribute represents the src file of the image the alt attribute specifies alternative incase of the src doesnt work, represenst info of the img  -->
    <!-- we can add attribute width and height to adjust size of the img (in pixels)-->
    <!-- .. represents go out of the current folder you are in ../.. means go out of sub,sub folder -->

    <!-- TABLES-->
    <table border>
      <!-- border means create a border for the table -->
      <!-- the table element/structure consists of 2 sub elements a thead and a tbody same idea as our main structure but we add a t in the beggining-->
      <!-- the thead consists of declaration of the table (columns) & the tbody consists of the rows aka data of the table-->

      <thead>
        <!-- in the thead we intialize our table columns to do so:  we create 1 row (tr)<to create the inital bar> and within this row we declare our coloumns-->
        <tr>
          <th>Names</th>
          <th>age</th>
          <!-- to create columns we create (th) -->
          <!-- so here we have a table consists 2 columns-->
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <!-- in the body we place data using tr (row)td(data for a square or block in that row), and we place the data row by row -->
        <!-- so here we have one row which has 2 data one omar and one 21(one for name and one for age ) -->
        <!-- we add data row by row: we create a row and open td and fill out our data column by coloumn then close the row. To add another line we do the same thing tr .. td.. -->
        <!-- when filling out row by row . within the row the order of the td tags(single square/block of data) is proportional to the order of the th tags(column names) in the thead-->
        <!-- so when adding a row with 5 td tags, In the row the first tag represents data for 1st column(ex name) and 2nd td tag represents the data for the second column(ex age)-->
        <tr>
          <!-- row 1-->
          <td>Omar</td>
          <!-- col1-->
          <td>21</td>
          <!-- col2-->
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <!-- row2-->
          <td>Ahmed</td>
          <!--col1-->
          <td>21</td>
          <!--col2-->
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <!-- FORMS-->
    <form onsubmit="testmethod()">
      <!-- Form consists of container of labels and corresponding inputs-->
      <!-- Any Button/ input will take data or save data has to be inside a form. Place an action on the entire form 
       we can use on submit method(when the button in the form is submitted it goes to that method) in js we handle the method: 
       validation, ... backend tings using javascript, handle evrything regarding the elements of the form we don't need an onlick method and handle the button itself or place validations
       using html, all validations will e handeled using js -->
      <label for="emailinput">Email</label>
      <!-- Label represents the label of a specifc input-->
      <!-- the for attribute in the label means this label belongs to the input field of a certain id ex for="emailinput then thi label belongs to the input element that has id emailinput."-->
      <!-- so when i click on the label it focuses on the input feild associated with it thats associated wiht it-->
      <input
        id="emailinput"
        type="email"
        placeholder="Enter your email"
        required
      />
      <!-- input is a self closing tag, we need to specify the attribute type, which specifies the type of input and acts as validation for the input field-->
      <!-- in input placeholder represents the intial text that shows over the text box -->
      <!-- required means its a required feild aka needs to be filled -->
      <br />

      <label>Mobile</label>
      <input type="number" placeholder="Enter your mobile number" required />

      <br />
      <!-- br represents next line -->

      <label>Password</label>
      <input
        type="password"
        placeholder="Enter your password"
        required
        minlength="2"
        maxlength="7"
      />

      <!-- max/min length defines the maximum/minimum CHARACTERS that can be inputed in this feild-->

      <br />
      <br />

      <button>Sign in</button>
      <!-- Since this button is in the form, it will have action on the inputs of the form aka show validation message based on type, its best practice to include buttons regarding inputs INSIDE A FORM-->
      <button type="reset">reset</button>
      <!-- reset type means clear the input fields again if its not part of the form it will not have any functionality over the input fields-->
      <!-- button tag represents a button, the text of the button can be written in the middle of it, we can add an onlick method so when pressed it does a specifc thing & add a css class in the opening tag-->
      <!-- any button in the form that doesn't have a type is default submit type which means when clicked it takes the entire form to the onsubmit method specific to the form-->

      <br />

      <!-- LINKS-->>
      <a href="forgetpassword.html" target="_blank"> forgetpassword</a>
      <!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. 
        The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. Coudl be a page, email .. any link 
          To Make the link open in a new tab we use the attribute target. target="_blank"-->

      <!-- LINKS: TO SPECIFIC PART OF THE SAME PAGE -->

      <a href="#myButton">Go to My Button</a>
      <!-- Some content to create a scrollable page -->
      <p style="margin-top: 1000px">Scroll down to find the button</p>

      <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
      <!--To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the <a> element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol,
          followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to.-->
      <!-- Example: if this was a button aka linking to an element thats a button, when we click on the link it will redirect us to that element aka the button with id mybutton -->
