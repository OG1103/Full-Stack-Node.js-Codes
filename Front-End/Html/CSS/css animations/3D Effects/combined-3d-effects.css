/* 
  Combining 3D Transform Properties to Create Complex Effects

  By combining 'transform', 'perspective', 'transform-style', 'backface-visibility', and 'box-shadow', 
  you can create sophisticated 3D effects that enhance user interaction.
  
  Example: Creating a 3D Card Flip Effect with Shadow
*/

.card-container {
  perspective: 1000px; /* Sets the 3D perspective for child elements */
}

.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  transition: transform 0.6s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for transform and shadow */
  transform-style: preserve-3d; /* Preserves 3D positioning for child elements */
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Subtle shadow for a lifted effect */
  position: relative; /* For proper positioning of child elements */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Flips the card 180 degrees on hover */
  box-shadow: 0px 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhances shadow effect when hovered */
}

.card-face {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  backface-visibility: hidden; /* Hides the back face during rotation */
}

.card-front {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  /* Content styling for the front */
}

.card-back {
  background-color: #f3f3f3;
  transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Positions the back face for flipping */
  /* Content styling for the back */
}

/* 
    How They Work Together:
  
    - perspective: Applies a perspective to the 3D space, making the card appear to rotate around a point.
    - transform-style: Ensures that child elements are positioned in 3D space relative to their parent (the card).
    - backface-visibility: Hides the back side of the card when it's rotated to give a realistic flip effect.
    - transform: Rotates the card on the Y-axis to create the flip animation.
    - box-shadow: Adds depth and realism by creating a shadow effect that adjusts as the card is hovered over.
    
    By combining these properties, you achieve a dynamic 3D card flip effect that enhances the visual interaction on the webpage.
