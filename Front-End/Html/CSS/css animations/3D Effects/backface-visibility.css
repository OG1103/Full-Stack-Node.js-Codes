/* 
  6. backface-visibility: Defines whether the back face of an element is visible when it is rotated.
  
  The 'backface-visibility' property determines if the back side of a transformed element is visible when facing the viewer.
  This property is useful in 3D rotations to hide the backside of an element.
  
  Syntax:
    backface-visibility: visible | hidden;
  
  Parameters:
  - visible: The back face is visible when the element is rotated.
  - hidden: The back face is not visible when the element is rotated.
  
  Examples of using 'backface-visibility':
*/

/* Example 1: Hide Back Face */
.example-backface1 {
  backface-visibility: hidden; /* Hides the back face during a 3D rotation */
  transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Rotates element to its back face */
}

/* Example 2: Show Back Face (Default) */
.example-backface2 {
  backface-visibility: visible; /* Shows the back face during a 3D rotation */
  transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Rotates element to its back face */
}
